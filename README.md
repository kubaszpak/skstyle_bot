Python Bot for sstore domain webshops admin panel

**Version 1.0.3**

## Purpose

Its main feature is storaging new orders in a file and every couple of hours sending new client's addresses to put on a package

It's still work in progress

## Usage

To run: 

 - for now you need poetry as it is not a built package yet. You can install it with:

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python

 - download and add a chrome webdriver to your path

There is a great tutorial for that I found on YouTube (again if you are using Windows, on Mac you just have to unpack it and move it to !usr/local/bin):

 - run project with **poetry run main**
